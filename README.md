## Data Processing
n this project, we aimed to build on our previous work, which was centered around women. To maintain this focus, we processed the new dataset by filtering out male data, allowing us to continue our analysis exclusively on female-related information. This step allowed us to maintain consistency with the methodologies used in the prior analysis.
